# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data","movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

--> ANSWER: No missing values
```{r,skim_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

skim(movies)

```
- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

```{r,one_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

most_popular_genre_table <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count(genre) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
most_popular_genre_table

```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r,two_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ave_gross_budget <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(ave_gross=mean(gross),ave_budget=mean(budget))

return_on_budget <- ave_gross_budget %>%
  mutate(return_on_budget=ave_gross/ave_budget) %>%
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

return_on_budget
```
